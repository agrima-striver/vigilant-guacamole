Why Contribute to Open Source Software?
Open source software relies on contributors who are willing to improve existing projects, bring them up-to-date, and maintain them.
Whether you help improve documentation, fix bugs, or add features—you’ll be able to use your open source work as an opportunity to flex your coding muscle.
That’s not all—open source communities are a great place to meet new people.
How Can I Contribute?
Let me tell you an amazing thing there is more to open source than coding.
Here are a few ways in which you can contribute to an open source project:
*Submit a bug fix. 
*Add a new feature. 
*Update documentation.
*Answer questions. .
*Review code. 

#To help you get started, here are a few projects to which you can contribute:

These lists include a wide range of potential projects to which you can contribute. They are maintained by people in the open source community. If you find a good open source project on your search, feel free to add it to this list—that would be an open source contribution too!
There are a few factors you should consider when choosing a project. First, make sure the project is accepting contributions. Also, choose a project that really interests you.
If you really enjoy working with javascript, you should look for the top javascript projects to which you can contribute. 

#keep few things in mind before you submit a contribution to an open source project.
First, make sure the project you’re interested in is accepting contributions. There are a few ways that you can check if a project is looking for contributors. Here are a few techniques you can use:
-Check if the project has an open source license.
-Check if the project’s README.md file has a “contributors” section with information on how you can help out.
-View a project’s issues and pull requests. If there are any pending issues and pull requests, make sure there is an active discussion going on about those events; if there are no discussions, it may be because the project is not looking for contributors.
-Another way to check if a project is accepting outside contributions is to get in touch with the maintainers, the people responsible for maintaining a project. Have they indicated an interest in receiving help?
-You ideally want to pick a project with an active community. That way, if you get stuck or need help, you can easily find someone to help you.
